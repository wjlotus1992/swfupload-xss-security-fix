## SWFUpload 游子修正版

目前游子的修正版基于官方最新的2.2.0稳定版，修正了一个存在[XSS隐患的安全漏洞](https://nealpoole.com/blog/2012/05/xss-and-csrf-via-swf-applets-swfupload-plupload/)。请直接下载游子提供的版本，而非官方未修正版版本。

[SWFUpload](http://code.google.com/p/swfupload/) is a JavaScript Library that wraps the Flash Player's upload function. It brings your uploads to the next level with Multiple File Selection, Upload Progress and Client-side File Size Checking.

Unlike other Flash upload tools, SWFUpload leaves the UI in the developer's hands. Using a set of event handlers developers can display upload progress and status to the user in their own HTML/CSS UI.

SWFUpload has been featured in such projects as [YouTube](http://youtube.com) and [WordPress](http://wordpress.com).
